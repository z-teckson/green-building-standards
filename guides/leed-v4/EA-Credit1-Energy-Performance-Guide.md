# LEED v4 EA Credit 1: Optimize Energy Performance Guide

## Credit Intent & Requirements

**Intent:** To achieve increasing levels of energy performance beyond the baseline defined in ASHRAE 90.1-2010 (or applicable standard) to reduce environmental and economic impacts associated with excessive energy use.

**Key Requirements:**
- Demonstrate a percentage improvement in the proposed building performance compared to the baseline building performance.
- Points are awarded on a sliding scale based on the percentage improvement (1–18 points for BD+C, 1–20 points for ID+C).
- Energy model must comply with Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2010 (or later) and include all energy end‑uses regulated by the standard.
- The baseline building design must meet the mandatory provisions of ASHRAE 90.1.

## Documentation Checklist

- [ ] **Energy Model Report** – Detailed output from the energy modeling software showing hourly/annual energy consumption.
- [ ] **Baseline Building Description** – Documentation of the baseline building characteristics (envelope, lighting, HVAC, service water heating, etc.) as defined in Appendix G.
- [ ] **Proposed Building Description** – Description of all energy‑efficiency measures incorporated in the design.
- [ ] **Input/Output Summary** – Clear summary of input parameters and major output metrics (e.g., EUI, cost, carbon).
- [ ] **ASHRAE 90.1 Compliance Report** – Verification that the baseline model meets all mandatory provisions.
- [ ] **LEED Submittal Forms** – Completed EA Credit 1 forms from the LEED Online portal.
- [ ] **Supporting Calcs** – Any supplementary calculations (e.g., daylighting controls, renewable energy, exceptional calculation method).
- [ ] **Modeler Credentials** – Resume or certification of the energy modeler (preferably a licensed engineer or certified simulation professional).

## Step‑by‑Step Process

1. **Kick‑off Meeting** – Gather the project team (architect, MEP engineer, energy modeler) to align on goals, schedule, and responsibilities.

2. **Collect Design Data** – Obtain architectural drawings, HVAC schedules, lighting plans, and equipment lists for the proposed design.

3. **Develop Baseline Model** – Create the baseline energy model strictly following Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1. Document all assumptions and input parameters.

4. **Develop Proposed Model** – Incorporate all energy‑efficiency measures (high‑performance envelope, efficient lighting, advanced HVAC, etc.) into the proposed model.

5. **Run Simulations** – Execute annual simulations for both baseline and proposed models using approved software (e.g., EnergyPlus, eQuest, IES‑VE).

6. **Calculate Percentage Improvement** – Compare the proposed building’s annual energy cost (or source energy) to the baseline’s annual energy cost.  
   `Improvement (%) = (Baseline Energy – Proposed Energy) / Baseline Energy × 100`

7. **Determine Points Earned** – Refer to the LEED v4 credit table to map the percentage improvement to the number of points achieved.

8. **Prepare Documentation** – Assemble the Energy Model Report, baseline/proposed descriptions, input/output summaries, and compliance reports.

9. **Review & Quality Check** – Have a second modeler or peer review the model and documentation for consistency and accuracy.

10. **Submit to LEED Online** – Upload all required documents into the EA Credit 1 section and complete the credit forms.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Incorrect Baseline Modeling** – Using the wrong climate zone, omitting mandatory provisions, or misinterpreting Appendix G rules can invalidate the entire analysis. *Always double‑check the baseline against ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G checklists.*

2. **Overlooking Regulated vs. Unregulated Loads** – LEED EA Credit 1 only considers regulated energy end‑uses (lighting, HVAC, service water heating, etc.). Do not include unregulated loads (e.g., plug loads, elevators) in the percentage improvement calculation unless they are part of an exceptional calculation method approved by GBCI.

3. **Insufficient Documentation** – Submitting an energy model report without clear narrative descriptions, input summaries, or modeler credentials can lead to a reviewer’s request for additional information, delaying certification. *Provide a standalone document that walks the reviewer through every step of the modeling process.*
